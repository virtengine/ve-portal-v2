<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
<p>
On your machine create public and private SSH keys using the command-line:
<pre class="code">mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
</pre>
</p>
<p>
You will be asked to confirm keys location and create passphrase to protect your private key:
<pre class="code">Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/b/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/b/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/b/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.</pre>
</p>
<p>
After successful creation you should copy id_rsa.pub (your public key)
content and paste it into "Public key" input on Add key page<br/>
For other Linux systems search instructions for your distribution.
</p>
<h3>OS X</h3>
<p>
Instructions are pretty much the same as for Linux,<br/>
but you may omit directory creation and enter only this line
<pre class="code"> ssh-keygen -t rsa</pre>
</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
On of the possible ways to create SSH keys on Windows is using <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">Git
Bash</a>.
This set of steps is based this tool, you need to install it to proceed further.
</p>
<p>
At first check if you already have public key, if so you can use it on our Add Key page.
Open Git Bash and enter:
<pre class="code"> ls -al ~/.ssh</pre>
This command will show existing files in your .ssh directory. Public key has .pub extension
(usually id_rsa.pub)
</p>
<p>
To generate new SSH key pair in your Git Bash enter:
<pre class="code"> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"</pre>
This will create new ssh key, using the provided email as a label, when you see information about
choosing keys directory just press Enter. <br/>
You will also be asked to enter a passphrase.
After all is done you will see output like this:
<pre class="code">
# Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
# Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
# The key fingerprint is:
# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com</pre>
</p>
<p>
Next, you have to enable your ssh-agent and add keys that you have created. <br/>
Open your Git Bash and start the agent:
<pre class="code">
# start the ssh-agent in the background
ssh-agent - s</pre>
Add your SSH key to ssh-agent:
<pre class="code">
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa</pre>
That's it, you are ready to go!
</p>
